# üìì YOLOv8 Training & Real-Time Inference

---

## 1. Introduction

* Short explanation of YOLOv8 and its use cases.
* Workflow overview: **dataset ‚Üí training ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí visualization ‚Üí real-time inference**.

---

## 2. Setup

* Install and import required libraries (Roboflow, Ultralytics, OpenCV, Matplotlib).
* Environment check.

---

## 3. Dataset Preparation

* Download dataset from **Roboflow** (Rock-Paper-Scissors).
* Split into `train`, `val`, and `test`.
* Generate `data.yaml` file with paths and class names.

---

## 4. Training YOLOv8

* Initialize model (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`).
* Train on dataset (epochs, batch size, image size).
* Store outputs in structured folders.

---

## 5. Training Results Visualization

* Display `results.png` (training curves).
![](run-yolov8-training/exp1/results.png)
* Display `confusion_matrix.png` (class-wise evaluation).
* Interpret metrics briefly.

---

## 6. Model Evaluation

* Load trained weights (`best.pt`).
* Run inference on test set.
* Save results into prediction folder.

---

## 7. **Images Section (Visualization of Predictions)**

This section focuses only on **visual results**:

* **Sample Images from Dataset**

  * Show raw dataset samples (one or two examples per class).
  * Helps readers understand the dataset before training.

* **Training Prediction Samples**

  * Display test predictions made by YOLOv8 after training.
  * Organize into a **grid layout** (e.g., 5 columns √ó multiple rows).
  * Each image shows bounding boxes with predicted labels and confidence.

* **Before vs. After Training** *(optional)*

  * Show a side-by-side comparison: raw test image vs. predicted image.

---

## 8. Real-Time Camera Inference

* Open webcam feed.
* Run model on live frames.
* Draw bounding boxes, labels, confidence scores.
* Show FPS counter.
* Exit with ‚Äúq‚Äù key.

---

## 9. Conclusion

* Recap the workflow.
* Highlight training performance and inference speed.
* Suggest improvements (longer training, bigger model, augmentation).

‚úÖ Now the notebook has a **dedicated Images Section**, where you show:

1. Sample dataset images.
2. Model predictions on test images in a grid.
3. Optional before/after comparison.
